WakeUpWell
==========

A different way to be woken up in the morning. Instead of being woken by the annoying sound of an alarm and feeling warm under the covers of your bed and not wanting to leave, a space heater will turn on a few minutes before your desired wakeup time to gently warm you up until you can get out of bed refreshed.
